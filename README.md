# Game of Thrones Death Prediction

This project uses machine learning methods to predict the probability of death (binary classification) of characters in the TV series “Game of Thrones” based on various characteristics (gender, house status, appearance in books, etc.).

## Project Description

The goal is to build a model that can determine whether a character will survive using data about the characters provided on the website http://awoiaf.westeros.org.

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Building a classification model
- Evaluating model quality using accuracy metrics
